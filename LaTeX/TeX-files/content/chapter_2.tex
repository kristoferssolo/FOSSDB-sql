\section{Features}
The platform will offer project listings that include project description, contributor,
license types, code hosting platforms, operating systems on which the app can run,
programming languages, stars, and project tags.
Users will be able to easily locate projects using the search and filter functionality that will allow them
to search by name, keyword, programming language, project tag, license type, and contributor.

The FOSSDB intends to implement several features in the long term to improve the platform's
functionality and user experience.
These features include notifications, a review and rating system and a dedicated website. 

Users will be able to receive notifications when other users are looking to collaborate
on a project to which they are interested in or have contributed to.
This will allow users to connect with other developers who share their interests,
fostering collaboration and innovation in the open-source software community. 

The rating and reviewing feature will allow users to give feedback and rate the
projects they have used or contributed to.
This will help other users make informed decisions about which projects
to use and contribute to, based on the experiences of other users. 

Finally, there are plans to create a dedicated website for the platform,
which will act as a central hub for discovering open-source software projects.
