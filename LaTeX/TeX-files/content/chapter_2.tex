The platform will offer project listings that include descriptions, contributors
(username, email, and password), license types, code hosting platforms,
programming languages, and project types.
Users can easily find projects using the search and filter features that allow them
to search by name, keyword, programming language, project type, license type, and contributors. 

The OSSDB intends to implement several features in the long run to improve the platform's
functionality and user experience.
Among the features are notifications, a review and rating system, and a dedicated website. 

Users will be able to receive notifications when other users request collaboration
on a project to which they are interested or have contributed.
This will allow users to connect with other developers who share their interests,
fostering collaboration and innovation in the open-source software community. 

The ratings and reviews feature will allow users to provide feedback and ratings on
projects they have used or contributed to.
This will assist other users in making informed decisions about which projects
to use and contribute based on the experiences of other users. 

Finally, there are plans to create a dedicated platform website that
will serve as a central hub for discovering open-source software projects.
